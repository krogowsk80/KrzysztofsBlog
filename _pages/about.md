I’ve spent 20 years in the trenches of data engineering and architecture. I’ve seen the same mistakes made across dozens of industries: over-complicated stacks, dashboards no one uses, and technical debt that slows companies to a crawl.

DataDiveCraft is where I document the reality of building and managing BI systems. This isn’t about chasing the latest hype; it’s about what works in production when the stakes are high.

## Who this is for

**Business Leaders & Stakeholders:** I translate complex architectural decisions into business logic. If you want to know how data architecture impacts your bottom line without the jargon, start here.

**Junior & Mid-level Engineers:** You’ll find "In the Workshop" posts designed to help you level up. I share the frameworks, SQL patterns, and design principles I use to build scalable, maintainable systems.

## What you’ll find here

- **The "Why" of Architecture:** Why we choose specific patterns over others.
- **Junior-to-Senior Guides:** Practical advice on moving from "writing code" to "designing solutions."
- **The ROI of Data:** How to make sure the work the data team does actually matters to the business.

I believe data is a craft. It takes time to master, but when done right, it’s the most powerful tool a business has.
