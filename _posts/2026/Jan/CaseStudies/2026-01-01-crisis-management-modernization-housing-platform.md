## The Strategic Challenge: “Rescuing a Failing Multi-Year Investment”

Two years into development, a high-visibility housing and homelessness data platform was failing in production. The system—intended to replace manual Excel-based reporting for funding and assistance programs—was plagued by brittle design and lack of governance.


### The “Optics” Crisis

The system’s failure was eroding stakeholder trust. My first priority was stabilizing the existing environment within 60 days to restore confidence while simultaneously identifying the deeper structural flaws in the data mart.


### The Cloud Deadlock

The Ministry viewed the cloud as high-risk. I needed to navigate intense internal politics and security concerns to create a viable path forward.


## The Architectural Intervention: “Governance and Transformation”

I was brought in to lead the turnaround, managing a cross-functional team of developers and QAs to re-engineer the platform for municipal-scale delivery.


* **Strategic Stabilization**: Within three months, I moved the system from “failed” to “functional.” I then led a full-scale architectural rework, replacing flawed database designs with a robust model aligned with actual business requirements.

* **De-Risking the Cloud**: To break the deadlock on Azure adoption, I co-led a strategic advocacy effort. By benchmarking against peer institutions (Banks/Other Ministries) and proposing an Anonymized Aggregation Strategy, I proved that the risk profile for a breach was minimal. This secured the first-ever Azure POC for the department.

* **Stakeholder Enablement**: Architected a “Transparency Portal” via SharePoint, providing municipalities with a data catalog, business glossary, and self-service reporting. This simplified complex data-sharing agreements and made funding allocation transparent for the first time.

* **DevOps Maturity**: Introduced CI/CD pipelines and formal QA/UAT environments, moving the organization from “emergency coding” to a professionalized release management lifecycle.

## The Business Outcome

* **Successful Provincial Launch**: The platform went live to external municipal agencies, receiving high praise for its usability and transparency.

* **Organizational Maturity**: Left the Ministry with a documented cloud roadmap and a stable, high-performance Tabular (SSAS) model.

* **The “Mission Accomplished” Exit**: Having built the framework and stabilized the team, I successfully transitioned the project to internal staff, ensuring the organization had the foundation to manage the asset independently.
